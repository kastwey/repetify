# Repetify

- [Versión en español](readme.es.md)

I developed this project for the students of the [Lemoncode Backend Bootcamp](https://lemoncode.net/bootcamp-backend#bootcamp-backend/inicio), to serve as an example for the architecture section of the bootcamp. Thanks, folks, for keeping your example repository public and allowing this project to keep evolving! And if you’ve landed here thinking: I’d love to learn more about .NET! … well, you know, they run a damn good bootcamp — and not just because I was part of it ;)
